## **Leading Indicators Definition**
"A leading indicator is an economic statistical indicator that changes before general economic conditions and therefore can be used to predict turning points in the business cycle" [Source](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Leading_indicator#:~:text=A%20leading%20indicator%20is%20an,points%20in%20the%20business%20cycle.)


List of Leading Indicators in the Power BI file:

9. Institute for Supply Management Report on Business Services PMI (ISM Services PMI)
10. University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSI)

Alone, these indicators are simply a small piece to the massive puzzle that is the US Economy. But together, they form a more complete view of where we've been, where we are, and where we're most likely headed in the next 6-12 months.

Most of the indicators have a KEY TAKEAWAY section explaining what they are and general principles around how they are to be understood.

However, Number 5 - Credit Spreads, does not. So I will do my best to explain them here:

### Credit Spreads
- The Corporate Bond Market in the US is the largest in the world and a huge source of financing for US Corporations and businesses. 
- Because of this, it is the most important Corporate Debt market in the world
- Financing through debt is often cheaper than financing through equity (stock) which allows Corporations to keep ownership of the company
- Credit Worthiness determines the price a Corporate Bond is issued at and it's tied to the Risk Free Rate aka the 10-Year Treasury Bond (Hence why the 10-yr is on the Credit Spreads tab)
- AAA is the highest rating with essentially the lowest risk and therefore a lower yield
- BBB is investment grade but a little more risky therefore a yields higher than AAA
- CCC is considered "Junk" bonds and is the riskiest of the three therefore returns the highest yield

Without going into too much depth (and to save you from boredom), it's important to keep track of the Bond Market and Credit Spreads because so much of the US and Global GDP depends on debt to keep things running. The higher the interest rates, the more "expensive" it is for companies to borrow money. The more expensive it is for companies to borrow money, the tighter their wallets get, more layoffs can occur, higher prices trickle down to the consumer... you get the idea.

A **general rule of thumb** is this: The higher the yield for the 10-year Treasury, the more likely it is the economy is looking bearish. The lower the yield, the more likely it is the economy is looking bullish.


### ISM Files
The 'ISM_Manufacturing_Index.xlsx' and 'ISM_Services_Index.xlsx' Excel files are the only manual updates needed for the Power BI file. Tab 3 labeled "PMI" is technicall the only tab that needs to be updated. There are some other [websites](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/business-confidence) that record the historical data for the ISM but they are lagging. I prefer the most updated data possible and if it's manual, so be it.
