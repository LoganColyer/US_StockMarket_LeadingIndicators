# US_StockMarket_LeadingIndicators
Power BI file of the US Stock Market Leading Indicators I use for investing

**Leading Indicators Definition**
"A leading indicator is an economic statistical indicator that changes before general economic conditions and therefore can be used to predict turning points in the business cycle" [Source](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Leading_indicator#:~:text=A%20leading%20indicator%20is%20an,points%20in%20the%20business%20cycle.)


List of Leading Indicators in the Power BI file:
1. Volatility Index (VIX)
2. Federal Funds Rate
3. 10's - 2's
4. Yield Curve
5. Credit Spreads
6. Treasury ETFs
7. M2 Money Supply
8. Institute for Supply Management Report on Business Manufacturing PMI (ISM Manufacutring PMI)
9. Institute for Supply Management Report on Business Services PMI (ISM Services PMI)
10. University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSI)
11. United States Building Permits


Alone, these indicators are simply a small piece to the massive puzzle that is the US Economy. But together, they form a more complete view of where we've been, where we are, and where we're most likely headed in the next 6-12 months.

Most of the indicators have a KEY TAKEAWAY section explaining what they are and general principles around how they are to be understood.

However, Number 5 - Credit Spreads, does not. So I will do my best to explain them here:
